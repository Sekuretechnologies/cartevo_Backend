# Cross-Environment Authentication Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of cross-environment authentication sharing between the production API (`https://api.cartevo.co`) and sandbox API (`https://apisandbox.cartevo.co`). The goal was to allow users to switch between environments without requiring re-authentication.

## Problem Statement

Previously, users had to log in separately to each environment (production and sandbox). When switching from production to sandbox (or vice versa), users were required to go through the complete authentication flow again, which included:

1. Entering credentials
2. Receiving and verifying OTP
3. Completing login process

This created a poor user experience and increased friction when testing or working across environments.

## Solution Implemented

### Technical Approach

The solution uses a shared JWT secret mechanism that allows tokens issued by one environment to be validated by the other. This is achieved by:

1. **Shared Cross-Environment Secret**: Both environments share a common `CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET` while maintaining individual `JWT_SECRET` values for enhanced security.

2. **Multi-Secret JWT Validation**: Modified the JWT strategy to attempt token validation with multiple secrets:

   - Primary: Environment-specific `JWT_SECRET`
   - Fallback: Shared `CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET`

3. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing authentication flows remain unchanged; the enhancement is transparent to users.

### Files Modified

#### Configuration

- `src/env.ts`: Added `CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET` environment variable
- `.env`: Added cross-environment secret configuration

#### Authentication Logic

- `src/modules/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`: Enhanced JWT strategy with multi-secret validation
- `src/utils/shared/encryption.ts`: Updated `decodeToken` function for cross-environment support
- `src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts`: Updated JWT verification in password reset and company selection flows
- `src/modules/user/user.service.ts`: Updated invitation token validation

## New User Flow

### Before Implementation

```
User logs into Production API
    ↓
Receives JWT token for Production
    ↓
User switches to Sandbox API
    ↓
User must login again to Sandbox
    ↓
Receives separate JWT token for Sandbox
```

### After Implementation

```
User logs into Production API
    ↓
Receives JWT token for Production
    ↓
User switches to Sandbox API
    ↓
Sandbox API accepts Production JWT token
    ↓
User is automatically authenticated in Sandbox
    ↓
No additional login required
```

### Detailed User Journey

1. **Initial Login** (Production or Sandbox)

   - User provides email and password
   - System sends OTP to email
   - User verifies OTP
   - Receives JWT token signed with environment's secret

2. **Environment Switching**

   - User switches from Production to Sandbox (or vice versa)
   - Frontend sends existing JWT token to new environment
   - New environment validates token using multi-secret approach
   - If validation succeeds, user is authenticated
   - If validation fails, user proceeds with normal login flow

3. **Token Validation Process**
   ```
   Receive JWT token
       ↓
   Try validation with local JWT_SECRET
       ↓
   If fails, try validation with CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET
       ↓
   If succeeds, authenticate user
       ↓
   If both fail, reject token
   ```

## Technical Implementation Details

### JWT Strategy Enhancement

The JWT strategy now uses a `secretOrKeyProvider` function that:

```typescript
secretOrKeyProvider: (request, rawJwtToken, done) => {
  // Try to verify with each secret
  let payload = null;
  let error = null;

  for (const secret of [env.JWT_SECRET, env.CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET]) {
    try {
      payload = jwt.verify(rawJwtToken, secret);
      break;
    } catch (err) {
      error = err;
    }
  }

  if (payload) {
    done(null, payload);
  } else {
    done(error, null);
  }
};
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Production Environment
JWT_SECRET="prod-specific-secret-key"
CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET="shared-cross-env-secret"

# Sandbox Environment
JWT_SECRET="sandbox-specific-secret-key"
CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET="shared-cross-env-secret"
```

## Deployment Requirements

### Environment Variables

Both production and sandbox environments must be configured with:

```bash
JWT_SECRET="<environment-specific-secret>"
CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET="<shared-secret-across-environments>"
```

### Security Recommendations

1. **Secret Management**: Use different `JWT_SECRET` values for each environment
2. **Shared Secret Security**: The `CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET` should be treated with the same security as individual secrets
3. **Secret Rotation**: Implement proper secret rotation procedures for both individual and shared secrets

### Build and Deployment

The implementation is backward compatible and requires:

- Standard NestJS build process
- No database schema changes
- No additional dependencies

## Security Considerations

### Token Security

- All existing token security measures remain intact
- Token expiration, blacklisting, and structure validation unchanged
- Cross-environment tokens have same security properties as local tokens

### Authentication Flow Security

- OTP verification still required for initial login
- Password validation unchanged
- User session management unaffected

### Potential Risks

- **Secret Compromise**: If `CROSS_ENV_JWT_SECRET` is compromised, attackers could forge tokens for both environments
- **Token Leakage**: Leaked tokens could be used across environments
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper monitoring, logging, and token rotation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- JWT strategy multi-secret validation
- Token verification functions
- Environment variable handling

### Integration Tests

- Cross-environment token acceptance
- Authentication flow preservation
- Error handling for invalid tokens

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. Login to Production → Switch to Sandbox
2. Login to Sandbox → Switch to Production
3. Invalid token handling
4. Token expiration across environments
5. Logout behavior

## Monitoring and Logging

### Recommended Monitoring

- Cross-environment authentication success/failure rates
- Token validation errors
- Environment switching patterns
- Security incidents related to token misuse

### Logging Enhancements

- Log cross-environment token validations
- Track environment switching events
- Monitor for suspicious authentication patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Environment-Specific Tokens**: Add environment identifier to tokens
2. **Selective Sharing**: Allow configuration of which environments can share authentication
3. **Token Scope Limiting**: Restrict cross-environment token permissions
4. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging of cross-environment activities

### Scalability Considerations

- Shared secret approach scales well for multiple environments
- No additional database load
- Minimal performance impact on authentication
