## üìä Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios:

```bash
# Create card with funding
POST /cards -d '{"customer_id":"cus123","company_id":"cmp456","amount":50}'

# Fund existing card
POST /cards/{id}/fund -d '{"amount":25,"company_id":"cmp456"}'

# Withdraw from card
POST /cards/{id}/withdraw -d '{"amount":10,"company_id":"cmp456"}'

# Get card details (with real-time balance)
GET /cards/{id}?company_id=cmp456

# Terminate card (with automatic refund)
DELETE /cards/{id} -d '{"reason":"Customer request","company_id":"cmp456"}'
```
