## Architecture Highlights

### 1. **Production-Grade API Integration**

- Complete Maplerad API wrapper with all endpoints
- Full customer enrollment with KYC support
- Multiple card types (retail, lite, corporate)
- Advanced transaction processing
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

### 2. **Webhook Processing Excellence**

- Handles 10+ different webhook event types
- Sophisticated event processing with async optimization
- Automatic transaction correlation and fee management
- Advanced failure handling and recovery mechanisms
- Real-time balance synchronization

### 3. **Business Logic Sophistication**

- Multi-currency support (USD, XAF, NGN)
- Complex fee calculation with range-based pricing
- First card vs additional card logic
- Automatic fund reservation and rollback
- Customer enrollment with document verification

### 4. **Data Management**

- Advanced synchronization between Maplerad and local database
- Balance transaction record tracking
- Comprehensive transaction correlation
- Metadata caching and cleanup mechanisms

## Key Features

### Advanced Card Issuance Workflow

- Multi-step card creation with status tracking
- Automatic customer enrollment with full KYC
- Fund reservation before external API calls
- Webhook-based asynchronous completion
- Automatic cleanup and error recovery

### Comprehensive Webhook System

```typescript
// Supported webhook events:
- issuing.transaction (payment processing)
- issuing.created.successful (card creation success)
- issuing.created.failed (card creation failure)
- issuing.terminated (card termination)
- issuing.charge (failure fee processing)
```

### Sophisticated Fee Management

- Range-based fee calculations
- Different fees for card types (retail: 500 XAF, lite: 300 XAF)
- Success vs failure fee differentiation
- Multi-currency fee conversion
- Automatic fee collection and debt management

### Advanced Error Handling

- Custom error classes with specific codes
- Automatic fund refunding on failures
- Post-API-call error handling (funds kept if service delivered)
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Circuit breaker patterns for external calls

## Technical Implementation

### Database Integration

- TypeORM with complex entity relationships
- Multiple specialized repositories
- Advanced querying with joins and relations
- Balance transaction record tracking
- Metadata caching systems

### External API Management

- Comprehensive Maplerad API client
- Customer enrollment and management
- Card lifecycle management
- Transaction processing and synchronization
- Balance inquiries and updates

### Configuration Management

- Environment-based configuration
- Structured configuration objects
- Service initialization patterns
- Feature flags and toggles

## Development Maturity
